# 11_Offline_Sync_And_Resilience.txt

## 🚫 Offline-First Mindset
- Moving crews often operate in low-connectivity zones
- App must work fully offline with no data loss
- Auto-reconnect & retry logic on mobile devices

---

## 🔗 Local Storage Strategy
- IndexedDB for mobile browser cache
- Form inputs saved as JSON blocks
- Media (photos/video) stored in browser memory until sync
- Role-aware form chunking: only relevant sections are cached

---

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution Logic
- Each entry has a version + timestamp
- If online: server wins
- If offline changed: user prompted to merge (or override)
- Visual indicators of conflict, unsynced data, or errors

---

## 🌐 Sync Engine Flow
1. Background worker monitors connectivity
2. On reconnect:
   - Queue flushed in order of creation
   - Media uploaded last (bulk async)
   - UI updated with live status

---

## 🛡️ Security Offline
- Media stored in browser with AES encryption
- JWT tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies
- Sensitive keys never stored client-side

---

## ✅ UX Considerations
- Offline banner or icon visible
- Retry/force-sync button available
- All actions log locally for audit trail replay

### **Access Control & Permissions**
```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 .backup_key          # Encryption key: owner read/write only
chmod 755 backups/             # Backup directory: owner full, others read/execute
chmod 644 *.log               # Log files: owner read/write, others read
```

**Security Features:**

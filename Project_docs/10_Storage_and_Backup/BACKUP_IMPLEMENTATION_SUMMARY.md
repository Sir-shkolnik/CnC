- **✅ Salt:** Random salt for each backup
- **✅ Integrity Verification:** Cryptographic checksums

### **Access Control & Permissions**
```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 .backup_key          # Encryption key: owner read/write only
chmod 755 backups/             # Backup directory: owner full, others read/execute
chmod 644 *.log               # Log files: owner read/write, others read
```

**Security Features:**
- **✅ Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal required permissions
- **✅ Owner-Only Access:** Critical files restricted to owner
- **✅ Audit Trail:** All access logged and monitored
- **✅ Separation of Duties:** Different roles for different operations

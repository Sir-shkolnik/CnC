## ü§ñ Core Vision
AI will enhance operations‚Äînot replace humans. Every automation must:
- Improve decision speed or clarity
- Reduce repetitive work
- Improve compliance or risk awareness
- Add value for cost-saving or upselling

---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Light AI (Immediate MVP)
- Auto-fill common fields based on prior jobs (crew, trucks, times)
- Auto-tag photos with labels ("stairs", "damage", "tools")
- Auto-score compliance on journey form completion
- Smart autocomplete for dispatcher instructions

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 2: Smart Observers
- Crew performance score engine
- Real-time flagging (e.g. missing signatures or photos)
- Smart ETA calculations from GPS drift
- Audit assistant with anomaly detection

---

## üß∞ Phase 3: Advanced AI (After Stable MVP)
- NLP assistant for dispatchers ("summarize this journey")
- Route optimization with weather + traffic
- Predictive job costing by type + team history
- Fraud detection flags

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack
- Python microservice or Next.js edge function
- Trained on company-specific data only
- Use OpenAI, Gemini, or local LLM (llama3 etc.)
- Opt-in per client
- All AI outputs are reviewed before critical actions

---

## üõå Privacy & Data Boundaries
- No photos or user data sent to public models
- All media AI is on-device or via private endpoint
- AI flags are non-decisive (human required to confirm)

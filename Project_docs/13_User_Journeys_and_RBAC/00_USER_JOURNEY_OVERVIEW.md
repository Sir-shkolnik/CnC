## �� **RBAC LOGIC & PERMISSIONS**

### **��️ Permission System Implementation**

#### **📊 Role Permissions Matrix**
```typescript
// Role-based permissions mapping
const ROLE_PERMISSIONS: Record<UserRole, Permission[]> = {
  ADMIN: [
    'user.create', 'user.edit', 'user.delete', 'user.view',
    'journey.create', 'journey.edit', 'journey.delete', 'journey.view',
    'client.create', 'client.edit', 'client.delete', 'client.view',
    'crew.assign', 'crew.view', 'audit.view', 'audit.create',
    'feedback.view', 'feedback.create', 'settings.edit', 'settings.view',
    'storage.create', 'storage.edit', 'storage.delete', 'storage.view',
    'booking.create', 'booking.edit', 'booking.delete', 'booking.view'
  ],
  MANAGER: [
    'user.view', 'journey.create', 'journey.edit', 'journey.view',
    'client.create', 'client.edit', 'client.view', 'crew.assign', 'crew.view',
    'audit.view', 'feedback.view', 'feedback.create', 'settings.view',
    'storage.view', 'booking.view'
  ],
  DISPATCHER: [
    'journey.create', 'journey.edit', 'journey.view', 'client.view',
    'crew.assign', 'crew.view', 'feedback.view', 'storage.view'
  ],
  DRIVER: [
    'journey.view', 'client.view', 'feedback.create', 'storage.view'
  ],
  MOVER: [
    'journey.view', 'client.view', 'feedback.create'
  ],
  AUDITOR: [
    'journey.view', 'audit.view', 'audit.create', 'feedback.view'
  ]
};
```

#### **🔐 Authentication & Security Logic**
```typescript
// JWT Token Structure
{
  jwtToken: {
    sub: "user_id",
    email: "user@example.com", 
    role: "DISPATCHER",
    client_id: "client_id",
    location_id: "location_id",
    exp: 1234567890
  }
}

// Super Admin Session Structure
{
  superAdminSession: {
    session_token: "uuid-token",
    super_admin_id: "admin_id",
    current_company_id: "company_id",
    permissions: ["VIEW_ALL_COMPANIES", "CREATE_USERS"],
    expires_at: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### **🔄 Role Validation Logic**
```typescript
// Role validation middleware
const require_roles = (...roles: string[]) => {
  return (user: AuthenticatedUser = Depends(get_current_user)) => {
    if (!user.has_role(...roles)) {
      throw HTTPException(
        status_code=403,
        detail=f"Access denied. Required roles: {', '.join(roles)}"
      )
    }
    return user
  }
}

// User permission checking
class AuthenticatedUser {
  has_role(self, *roles: str) -> bool:
    return self.role in roles
  
  can_access_location(self, location_id: str) -> bool:
    if self.role == "ADMIN":
      return True
    return self.location_id == location_id
  
  can_access_client(self, client_id: str) -> bool:
    if self.role == "ADMIN":
      return True
    return self.client_id == client_id
}
```

## 📱 **MOBILE STATE MANAGEMENT**

### **🔄 Mobile Field Operations Store**

#### **�� State Structure**
```typescript
interface MobileFieldOpsState {
  // Session & Authentication
  session: MobileSession | null;
  user: User | null;
  location: Location | null;
  client: Client | null;
  permissions: MobilePermissions | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  
  // Journey Data
  currentJourney: Journey | null;
  pendingJourneys: Journey[];
  completedJourneys: Journey[];
  
  // Journey Steps & Progress
  journeySteps: MobileJourneyStep[];
  currentStep: number;
  progress: JourneyProgress | null;
  
  // Offline Data
  offlineData: OfflineData;
  pendingUpdates: MobileJourneyUpdate[];
  mediaQueue: MobileMediaItem[];
  
  // Location & GPS
  locationData: LocationData | null;
  isLocationEnabled: boolean;
  
  // Sync & Connectivity
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  isOnline: boolean;
  
  // UI State
  uiState: MobileUIState;
  
  // Notifications
  notifications: MobileNotification[];
  
  // Quick Actions
  quickActions: QuickAction[];
}
```

#### **🎯 UI State Management**
```typescript
// Mobile UI State
{
  uiState: {
    isLoading: boolean,
    error: string | null,
    currentView: 'login' | 'journey' | 'steps' | 'media' | 'gps' | 'chat' | 'settings',
    offlineMode: boolean,
    syncStatus: {
      isOnline: boolean,
      lastSync: string,

      pendingMedia: number,
      syncProgress: number
    },
    notifications: MobileNotification[],
    quickActions: QuickAction[]
  }
}
```

#### **⚡ Quick Actions System**
```typescript
// Default Quick Actions
const defaultQuickActions: QuickAction[] = [
  {
    id: 'add_photo',
    label: 'Add Photo',
    icon: 'Camera',
    color: 'primary',
    onClick: () => { /* Camera capture logic */ }
  },
  {
    id: 'update_location',
    label: 'Update Location',
    icon: 'MapPin',
    color: 'secondary',
    onClick: () => { /* GPS update logic */ }
  },
  {
    id: 'start_journey',
    label: 'Start Journey',
    icon: 'Play',
    color: 'success',
    disabled: hasActiveJourney,
    onClick: () => { /* Journey start logic */ }
  },
  {
    id: 'complete_journey',
    label: 'Complete',
    icon: 'CheckCircle',
    color: 'success',
    disabled: !hasActiveJourney,
    onClick: () => { /* Journey completion logic */ }
  }
];
```

## �� **SMART NAVIGATION LOGIC**

### **🎯 Interface Detection & Routing**

#### **📱 Smart Route Logic**
```typescript
// Smart routing based on role and device
const getSmartRoute = (
  userRole: UserRole,
  deviceType: 'mobile' | 'desktop',
  currentPath: string,
  hasActiveJourney: boolean
): string => {
  // Auto-redirect based on role and device
  if (deviceType === 'mobile' && ['DRIVER', 'MOVER'].includes(userRole)) {
    if (currentPath === '/dashboard') return '/journey/current';
    if (currentPath === '/journeys') return '/journey/current';
  }
  
  return currentPath;
};
```

#### **🎯 Menu Item Generation**
```typescript
// Smart menu item generation
const generateSmartMenuItems = (
  userRole: UserRole,
  interfaceConfig: InterfaceConfig,
  userContext: UserContext,
  realTimeData?: RealTimeData
): MenuItem[] => {
  // Get base menu items based on role
  let baseItems: MenuItem[] = [];
  
  if (['DRIVER', 'MOVER'].includes(userRole)) {
    baseItems = fieldWorkerMenuItems;
  } else if (['DISPATCHER', 'MANAGER', 'ADMIN'].includes(userRole)) {
    baseItems = managementMenuItems;
  }
  
  // Filter items based on interface configuration
  let filteredItems = baseItems.filter(item => {
    // Check role permissions
    if (item.roles && !item.roles.includes(userRole)) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Check interface type restrictions
    if (interfaceConfig.type === 'MOBILE_FIELD_OPS') {
      // Field workers on mobile see only journey-related items
      return item.id === 'current_journey' || 
             item.id === 'journey_steps' || 
             item.id === 'media_upload' || 
             item.id === 'gps_tracking' || 
             item.id === 'crew_chat' ||
             item.id === 'settings';
    }
    
    return true;
  });
  
  return filteredItems;
};
```

## �� **JOURNEY WORKFLOW LOGIC**

### **📋 Journey Step Management**

#### **🎯 Step Completion Logic**
```typescript
// Journey step completion
const completeJourneyStep = (stepId: string) => {
  set(state => ({
    journeySteps: state.journeySteps.map(step =>
      step.id === stepId ? { ...step, status: 'completed' } : step
    ),
    currentStep: state.currentStep + 1,
    progress: state.progress ? {
      ...state.progress,
      completedSteps: state.progress.completedSteps + 1,
      progressPercentage: ((state.progress.completedSteps + 1) / state.progress.totalSteps) * 100
    } : null
  }));
};

// Journey step skipping
const skipJourneyStep = (stepId: string) => {
  set(state => ({
    journeySteps: state.journeySteps.map(step =>
      step.id === stepId ? { ...step, status: 'skipped' } : step
    ),
    currentStep: state.currentStep + 1
  }));
};
```

#### **📊 Progress Tracking**
```typescript
// Journey progress structure
interface JourneyProgress {
  totalSteps: number;
  completedSteps: number;
  currentStep: number;
  progressPercentage: number;
  estimatedCompletion: string;
  actualStartTime: string;
}

// Progress update logic
const updateProgress = (progress: JourneyProgress) => {
  set({ progress });
};
```

# 🔐 **RBAC SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION - Complete Role-Based Access Control**

**System:** C&C CRM - Complete Operations Management System  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - RBAC fully implemented and working  
**Last Updated:** August 8, 2025  
**Version:** 3.2.0  

---

## 🎯 **RBAC SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The C&C CRM implements a **comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system** that ensures users only have access to the features and data they need based on their role. The system automatically routes users to the appropriate interface after login and enforces role-specific permissions throughout their journey.

---

## 🔐 **RBAC AUTHENTICATION FLOW**

### **🔄 Unified Login with Role Detection**

#### **Login Process Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. User accesses unified login
URL: /auth/login

// 2. User selects company and enters credentials
{
  email: "user@company.com",
  password: "password123",
  companyId: "clm_company_id"
}

// 3. System detects user role automatically
const detectUserType = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const userResponse = await fetch('/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password, company_id: selectedCompany?.id })
  });
  
  if (userResponse.ok) {
    const userData = await userResponse.json();
    
    // Store authentication data
    localStorage.setItem('access_token', userData.access_token);
    localStorage.setItem('user_data', JSON.stringify(userData.user));
    
    const role = userData.user?.role || '';
    const userType = userData.user?.user_type || '';
    
    // Role-based routing logic
    if (role.toUpperCase() === 'SUPER_ADMIN' || userType === 'super_admin') {
      return 'super'; // Super Admin Portal
    }
    
    if (['DRIVER', 'MOVER'].includes(role.toUpperCase())) {
      return 'mobile'; // Mobile Field Operations
    }
    
    return 'web'; // Web Management Portal
  }
};

// 4. Automatic redirect based on role
switch (userType) {
  case 'super':
    router.push('/super-admin/dashboard'); // Super Admin Portal
    break;
  case 'mobile':
    router.push('/mobile'); // Mobile Field Operations
    break;
  case 'web':
    router.push('/dashboard'); // Web Management Portal
    break;
}
```

#### **✅ RBAC Routing Matrix:**
| Role | Login URL | Redirect To | Interface | Access Level |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **SUPER_ADMIN** | `/auth/login` | `/super-admin/dashboard` | Super Admin Portal | System-wide across all companies |
| **ADMIN** | `/auth/login` | `/dashboard` | Web Management Portal | Company-wide within assigned company |
| **DISPATCHER** | `/auth/login` | `/dashboard` | Web Management Portal | Assigned locations only |
| **DRIVER** | `/auth/login` | `/mobile` | Mobile Field Operations | Own journeys only |
| **MOVER** | `/auth/login` | `/mobile` | Mobile Field Operations | Own journeys only |
| **MANAGER** | `/auth/login` | `/dashboard` | Web Management Portal | Assigned locations with oversight |

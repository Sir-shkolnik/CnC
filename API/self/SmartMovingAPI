Here’s what I found about **SmartMoving’s API**, the open API offerings tailored to moving companies—perfect for streamlining CRM, operations, and integrations:

## What Is SmartMoving's Open API?

SmartMoving's **Open API** enables seamless automation and integration with external systems. It’s available to users on the Growth Plan, with two tiers:

* **Standard API** (included in Growth Plan): **Read-only access**—ideal for extracting data and generating custom reports.
* **Premium API** (paid add-on): **Full read/write access**, enabling real-time sync with external systems. ([smartmoving.com][1])

## Key Use Cases

According to their blog, “Unlock Efficiency: 6 Ways to Use SmartMoving's New API” (Sep 2024), popular use cases include:

1. **Custom Reporting Dashboards** – Connect to tools like Tableau or Power BI to visualize job and customer metrics.
2. **Project Management Workflows** – Use webhooks to send leads or booked moves into platforms like Asana or Monday automatically.
3. **Phone System Integration** – Route incoming calls based on SmartMoving CRM data like leads or booked jobs.
4. **Sales Tool Sync** – Keep systems like Salesforce up‑to‑date with lead, customer, and job data in real time.
5. **In-App Notifications** – Send alerts to messaging platforms (e.g., Teams, Slack) for new leads or booked moves.
6. **Automated Lead Ingestion** – Push leads from websites or third-party sources directly into SmartMoving without manual input. ([smartmoving.com][1])

## Webhook Functionality

SmartMoving supports event-driven workflows via webhooks:

* You can configure **webhooks** through the SmartMoving web interface (Settings → Integrations → SmartMoving API).
* Select events to subscribe to, define your callback URL, and optionally include custom headers (e.g., API key).
* Once set, SmartMoving will POST notifications to your URL whenever those events occur. ([SmartMoving API Developer Portal][2])

## Lead API Integration Guide

If you want to send leads into SmartMoving programmatically, their **Lead API** lets you do just that:

* Submit via HTTP POST to:
  `https://api.smartmoving.com/api/leads/from-provider/v2?providerKey={your_provider_key}`
* Use JSON payloads with required fields: either `"FirstName"` & `"LastName"` or `"FullName"`.
* Include optional lead details: phone, email, move date, origin/destination, service type, etc.
* Fields like `ReferralSource` or `MoveSize` must align with SmartMoving's settings (or they'll auto-create new entries). ([help.smartmoving.com][3], [help.smartmoving.com][4])
